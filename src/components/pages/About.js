    <p>
    Budding developer with problem solving and process optimization background, including more than 5 years of leadership. Academic achievements include President’s List, National Technical Honors Society, 3.4 GPA and recently earned Full Stack Development Certificate at Southern Methodist University. Workplace accolades include numerous MVP awards and “Member of the Year”.

In my first year as Internal Assistant Service Manager at Park Place, I was able to build a relationship and collaborate with four separate teams to achieve a 30% reduction in cycle time for pre-owned vehicle reconditioning.

By nature I am a focused, resilient and passionate perfectionist. As luck would have it, those attributes align extremely well with programming. I find myself eager to learn how things work and rally my peers to bond and collaborate efficiently, while having fun! By leveraging technical expertise and emotional intelligence, I’m a unique contributor that adds value, efficiency and motivation to my team.
My hobbies include archery, auto racing, food, smoking/grilling, dry aging beef, carpentry, design, coffee, tea and now coding.
